We used Servicestore as we had mice in our flat. Was really pleased with the service - one treatment and two follow ups to check the mice had gone. Lovely, polite workers. Good communication throughout. And reasonable price. Would definitely use again.

This was my second time using the LBWF gardening service. In between I used a different company (because it was last minute and I couldn’t wait) but won’t use them again. Now having had the LBWF service store this second time, I will not go anywhere else. Two very polite, friendly, knowledgeable and professional gentlemen who had quite a bit of hedgetrimming, weeding, mowing and tree reducing work to do. They were superb, worked quickly yet thoroughly. Rates are reasonable and they made sure I was satisfied with the garden before they left. Many thanks to Herve and Saied for leaving my garden looking neat, weed free and ready to rest over Winter. Thoroughly recommend these gentlemen. Very happy with their work

A valued member of the team Servicestore and society.

Waltham Forest Servicestore and particularly Ali Shikheey were of great help to me at a very difficult time for myself with my Mother in hospital after being in a critical condition, he managed to offer help over and above what I would of expected and in such a short period of time. This enabled my mother to return home where in terms of infection she was much safer after a serious illness. I can not thank him enough for his efforts.

Water butt- top marks!

We had a Water butt fitted in our rear garden and the service couldn’t be bettered. The very polite, efficient and considerate fitter arrived at a very reasonable hour; we talked briefly about where it would best be put and then he just got on with it. Within twenty minutes he was done, explained how it worked and then left. Really appreciated that he used shoe covers whenever he went through the house. Top marks for a great service.

Ali was incredibly professional, thorough, and detail-oriented throughout the entire process. He took his time to talk me through my options, explaining every aspect of the survey in clear, understandable terms, and making sure I felt confident in the findings. His punctuality and friendly approach made the experience even more positive. I would highly recommend Ali to anyone in need of a property survey – his expertise and excellent customer service truly stand out.

Having my new water butt installed by Sayed was a complete pleasure. He was very considerate about taking the butt through the house carefully so as not to damage anything… then he took me through the process of fitting, explaining how things worked. He did a very professional job of fitting it and of cleaning up afterwards. If there is a problem with the installation, though, it’s great to know that Servicestore will come back and rectify it. Thanks to Sayed especially and to everyone involved in this scheme to reduce flood risk over the wider area by having rainfall collected and then slowly used on our gardens!

I used the service to remove some big furniture items I needed to clear out of the house. The service was really affordable and I received a response to my quote request form really quickly. The team who came were amazing and did a great job. My only constructive feedback is to create a better booking system and flexibility - I was sent an email with an allocated date and time, there was no discussion or consulting with me when would work, and it wasn't possible to receive a narrowed down time slot and was simply given a "9am - 4pm" timeframe. Given we don't live at the property, that was stressful for us to arrange. However, I appreciate that the collection team did call ahead of time as I had requested and waited for us to arrive.

Water butt installation

I used the Service Store to get a *free* water butt installed. What a great service from the council.
Unfortunately the water butt was installed in the wrong place while I was out but I called the team and they came back and moved it without any problems. Many thanks to Hawa and the team for being so helpful.
In summary - make sure you will be in when they do the work to make sure you’re happy with it. They are a helpful team and it’s a great service.

Chris came to install water butt, but noted that we have cast iron drain pipes that are incompatible with the necessary kit. So instead he linked two water butts together to double our capacity, helping us with water for the garden as well as contributing to flood prevention. He knew exactly what to do, was very cheerful and completed the job quickly and effectively.

Good but did not help

The person who installed things to help make my home warmer was good. However, it did not make a difference. They claimed that there are no gaps in the windows, but this is not true. There are gaps, that is why rain gets inside even when the windows are closed and we can feel the draft. Even with the radiators on, it is still cold in the bedroom, which is not good as we have a baby we try to keep warm during the winter period.

Water butt installation

Sayed was very polite and installed the water butt quickly and with the minimum of fuss. Not so sure about the admin team though. They sent me the review request before I had even seen or heard from anyone and it had the wrong house number quoted. I got them to check they had the right number but they didn't pass that on to Sayed so he was knocking at the wrong door. Apart from that the service was good.

I agreed to have the water but installed, however, I was very unclear as to where the installation would be. Unfortunately there was very little information given at the initial survey. Unfortunately I did not have the but installed due to the location. The operatives that came were absolutely charming and did not pursue me to have the installation. The operatives showed their id, were pleasant and well spoken.

Good wash cleaned bins

I had my bins cleaned for a reasonable price . I think prices should vary if you are on benefits or pensioner. The job was done during the time frame and decent clean could use strong fragrance / chemicals but on the whole a good experience and job done .

One out of the three bins not…

One out of the three bins was not cleared or cleaned. As the refuse collectors haven’t emptied my brown bin in over two weeks (possibly deeming it not full enough to empty as it is less then 50% full), there was no way for me to have it clean enough to empty it as the council could have cleared it (unless there is a policy I am unaware of that states that a bin cannot be emptied of it’s contents if it is less than 50% full).

Please refund me the additional amount I was charged for the third bin to be cleaned as there will be no way that I will be able to rebook as I will not be able to demand that my brown bin be emptied when I am at work just so that it can be cleaned. 

Kind regards

UPDATE: I have since been refunded and have adjusted the rating accordingly as the bins that were cleaned were cleaned well. Will leave the main message on to warn other users that bins will need to be emptied before they are cleaned so it’s worth booking this service the day after refuse collections

Sixth visit - rats still here - waste of money 

Sixth visit from pest control to get rid of rats but they’re still here. Pest control think it’s a thames water problem but I’ve had the pipes checked. So I’ve paid a lot of money for the service but I still have the rats.
Nice guys, helpful and polite, lots of suggestions, but . . . 
Despite what is said below, there was evidence of rats ie similar to previous visits, in that the poison had gone, if there were no rats, then the poison would still be there. So rats are still there. Secondly I was indeed sent information but it was about mice , inside the house which is not my problem. Lastly it’s advice not advise.

Adequate bin cleaning service

Bin cleaning service was adequate. Operatives came on the day I'd booked, although not quite sure why I was asked to book a morning or afternoon slot when the confirmation email said the operative would arrive between 9 and 4. They came in the morning (I'd actually booked the afternoon slot) and did a one-off clean of all 3 bins. There was still some dirt stuck at the bottom and sides of the brown bin, which I had to clean off - whilst it had been some time since it had been cleaned, I would have thought the operative would have checked and ensured it was properly clean before leaving.

Job eventually done

The handyman was very polite. The light pendant was fitted with some difficulty. After light fitted realised after the handyman had left that the rest of my upstairs light were not working. I called the office to inform them of this, to be told BUT I must have had faulty electric. Firstly, the handyman attempted to fit the light without turning off the fuse and then blew something and surprised that the light didn’t work when initially fitted. Then he was on the phone for a year and a day talking to someone to try and fix the issue. 
After calling the office a second time and speaking to someone else, it was arranged for the handyman to return and sort out the problem, which he did on the same day.
3* because of the rudeness of the first person I spoke to informing them of what happened. Regarding the job, at present happy enough.

Paul is a great guy

Paul is a great guy. I gave 3 stars because i have bed bugs at home. They booked 2 treatment and they said they will get rid of bed bugs in 2 treatment. I had my 3rd treatment done but still i have bed bugs. I don't understand what spray are they using or their treatment method is not good. 70% bed bugs gone. But even if they leave 1 bug they will become thounsands soon. So totally unhappy.
Date of experience: 01 August 2023

I have looked into your job with our Customer Service Team and they have reported that unfortunately you did not follow the preparation steps required prior to Paul visiting. This may have had an impact on the success of the treatment we carried out. I can assure you that our bed bug spray is highly effective and carried out by experienced pest control officers. I note from your job file that Paul reports on the 3rd visit there were no signs of activity found.

If you would like to book in for another service if you feel you still have a problem with bed bugs, please do reach out to us for assistance. Please also make sure that you correctly prepare your home for the treatment. I wish you all the best.

The service was excellent. The workers were knowledgable and efficient. I am giving this a 3 because £80 is expensive for clipping a front hedge on a Warner house (narrow lot).

Mis-match with the bin crew timetable

I rated 'average' which is perceived by you as a negative review - it's not! Unfortunately, the service relies on the bin crew emptying bins as per the timetable. They didn't do this, so you were unable to clean all 3 bins. What you did do was fine, especially as the bins haven't been cleaned for years. I look forward to the next session. Thank you.

Warmer Homes needs more work

Scheduling and rescheduling a Warmer Homes visit through WF Servicestore was quite difficult (although the people at the end of the phone were incredibly nice!) which meant I wasn't able to be in when they visited my property and a friend had to be present. On my return I found I'd been left a load of energy-saving lightbulbs that didn't fit anything in my house. This could easily have been checked - I live in a one-bed, one storey flat so everything is on display. I think the intention of Warmer Homes is good but the organisation and implementation needs work, otherwise it's just a waste of expensive resources.

Pest control service complaint

I booked a service online and had spraying done. The serviceman was very good and polite and friendly and respectful. 
We are very disappointment that we were told the service was not the whole house and just 2 bedrooms only after spending all night and morning preparing the house for treatment and having everything in bags and in my garden. After speaki g again to the booking team i would still have to pay another fee for callout which has pit a strain on my finances beinng unemployed. Ibdont believe my problem will be resolved as i cannot afford to have treatment charges again.

I would sugvest you state no. of rooms to be treated on your bokking page be added with further message to indicate that these will be only rooms treated as this is a fair bit misunderstood and ehy would you not treat the property correctly and fully, especially when a family is living there and this problem us due to escalate and we had informed the serviceman the length of time the problem had occurred so they would know the treatment was needed throughout. 
I dont feel this is helping people and i believe it is morr for the councils own financial benefit. One distressed customer.

The email reminder was welcome but the time advice was misleading. It said see you around 9 but when the guys arrived they said that was not the case. Email should have said 'after nine'. (I was advised that it was an all day slot originally).
When there was no show by 9.40 I rang the number but it was not answered.

Patchy service

The Service Store office are generally helpful, and very polite- when you can get hold of someone!
The service overall though is patchy with the operative not always turning up. 

Communication is poor as customers are not advised of issues like the theft of the cleaning vehicle! Surely they can distribute an email to clients from their systems??

So I’m afraid they could do better

Waltham Forest council impounded my car…

Waltham Forest council impounded my car within 20 minutes of parking the car in a parking space. I didn't know what they changed me on, 5 hours I paid so they released the car to me, is when I found the ticket stuck on the car. 
I was forced to pay £265.00 to get back the car. I appealed this charge but never been replied to since three weeks.
So firstly, I was not allowed to see the parking charge notification ticket, or time to appeal and make the initial payment. 

I am still on this matter since a month now. So this is a rip off the Waltham forest council is embarking on to get people's money by force. 

I received a reply on the 20th August regarding this review where a company called Waltham forest service store claimed to be addressed to in this review.

NO. Don't confuse me again. I did not have anything to do with Waltham forest Service store. This is regarding a parking issue concerning a council. So this review stands for what Waltham Forest council did because the place I parked the car was own by the Waltham forest council.

Service was extremely poor

Service was extremely poor. Garden fence removal requested Wed 24/7/24 which included up-loaded pic of the material which I had moved to my front garden. I was then told it would take 3 working days to get a quote for the work. When quote provided it was accompanied with a demand for payment before I could be given a date for the rubbish removal. Work finally done on Wed 31/7/24. I could have had the work done, cheaper by 2 other people who where driving pass an offered to remove the rubbish there and then. I worry that they might have dumped the stuff under a bridge on the A406 or in a field off the M11 but at least it would have been done quickly.

Can not believe this is a service

Can not believe this is a service! I got charged £150 for a guy to come to my house for 10 minutes to put the exact same poison down that I already use. There is no removal of the problem, no blocking of entry and exit points. I have two more appointments for this guy to put the exact same poison down (which I bought online for way less than £150). I literally paid £150 for someone to do what I’m already doing. Edit after reply: Yes I did get in touch with the help desk no solution has been offered, this is a completely false statement! I was told someone will get back to me but no one has as of yet. I have 0 years of experience yet put in place the exact same method as your ‘experts’. I stand by what I have written, this method is not effective as the rats are free to re-enter from wherever they came from in the first place. The problem needs to be eradicated and steps put in place to ensure it cannot happen again.

Would not recommend 

I found Service Store online and sent a gardening/grounds maintenance enquiry for a block of flats I manage on 3rd June. Had a site visit for a quote on Friday 7th and was informed I'd have a quote within 3 working days. 3 weeks later and no one has been in touch, despite me asking multiple times for an update via email. Very poor service, they have wasted my time and delayed me finding a contractor for our building. Would not recommend.

Terrible service

I would definitely not use this service again. I paid £150 for a rat treatment which only included setting up rat traps on 3 visits. Complete waste of money and very expensive, as we still have the same issue. I do not recommend this service.

Garden was left looking identical to prior state…

We had work carried out on our garden on friday 05 April and on two occasions we were told it would take 2 men half a day to completely fix our garden. I paid the required staff and hours amount and an extra £90 for “removals”, in total i paid £330. My garden was left looking almost identical to the state it was in before as i have before and after pictures and a majority of items are left in the exact same spot they were before. The only noticeable difference was that a patch of grass had been cut. Our front door also got bent because of being slammed and was not locking, so i had to phone the council and they had to send a carpenter to fix it for the time being while it gets replaced. I emailed a staff member by the name of Hawa Esakji on Tuesday morning asking for the situation to be resolved and haven't gotten a reply back. 

Very unhappy with the quality of work carried out and by the lack of customer service. Would give no stars if possible.

Disappointed in the service booked a collection and they didn’t collect, no communication at all on the day. We had to call them to reschedule then they came and collected from the front door when we were not in, they took something they should’ve have but ok fine. 

The second time we booked same thing they didn’t show up no communication twice! then when we tried to reschedule they said we need to pay extra because we live in a flat (although the address clearly says that already) so not sure when that became an issues and why it wasn’t before? 

WF service store said the items to be collected are inside the property which is not true because they are outside my front door waiting to be collected as seen in a photo I sent them. 

They have wasted our time, I feel penalised for living in a flat, the staff don’t show up and no communication, no apology. The items are sitting outside my front door and can’t bring them in as they have been outside for 5 days now have to wait 10 days for a refund. 

Such a shame I don’t think I’ll be using them again such a poor service and I don’t think WF actually care.

Job was not completed

Job was not completed. I was told the contractor would come out to check for insulation and carry out other measures for my home. However the contractor did not even check the loft, instead put a few foil covers behind some of the radiators and left within 15 mins. Disappointed as it was not what had been spoken about over the phone. Wasted my time and took time off of work for no reason.

Still dissatisfied

I stayed at home once again but still did not receive what I was promised. I did not receive the tap adaptor nor the draught excluder cushion. These could've been provided for me at the library where I signed up for this service. However they did not want to give it to me there and now I'm having to go back and forth for what should've been provided.

Not happy with service, not given what I was told I would receive.

I have five rooms that I was entitled to 5 led bulbs for and was only given 4, 4th one at a push when I asked for it and he wasn't bothered to go back and get another. I have 2 radiators that are window facing and he only put reflective material behind one. Also didn't provide a draught excluder that I was told I would receive. Nor did he put the sink adapter on. He didn't advice me on what I could potentially get put in place for the winter to keep my home warmer. Out of all the windows he only put a strip on the bathroom window. Even though I can feel draught from other windows. Also left a screw half out of the strip on the lower part of my front door which is very dangerous as I have a baby.

Third time unlucky, missed appointments

They missed the original appointment (some issue afoot, take your pick of the usual), so we rescheduled. They missed the rescheduled appointment and sent an email confirmation of it being done. Tried to book in again but still no show, but did get another email confirmation saying it had been carried out, which it hadn't. No one manning the phones to talk to a human to resolve. When the actual work happens it's great, but seems their admin staff all need to be discontinued.

UPDATE: ServStore reached out via trust pilot saying I need to get in touch with them citing the ref number. Perhaps that's where I've gone wrong all this time! Oh, no wait, checking the last 6 emails sent to them, they ALL cite the reference number, and none of which have been replied to, so maybe, just maybe their admin team are as terrible as I have asserted.

Update 2:
You're stating and asking 2 conflicting things. Either I tell you my username / ref on the trust pilot forum, which I won't because it's public, OR I email your customer service with the reference number, which I have 6 times to no avail. I've spent 1hr total in a phone queue waiting to be connected so I'm not doing that route anymore. I'm not doing your job for you, how about you go through your inbox and resolve all unread emails / tickets. Clue: my issue is the one where there are 6 unactioned emails against it... do you have many of these?
Date of experience: 22 August 2023

UPDATE RESPONSE: Thank you for your further comments. Unfortunately from your Trustpilot username we cannot identify your customer name or email address. This was the reason we asked you to contact our helpdesk and quote your reference number. If you state you have sent several emails with no response then I would like to look into this matter for you. The only way I can do this is by getting more detail from you. I hope we can help get this matter resolved for you.

Wouldn’t take my wardrobe away

I booked the removal of a large wardrobe and on arrival was told they were expected it to be ready dismantled and would not be able to take it away. I had previously asked if they could dismantle it and was told yes. I am moving in three days and this has really added to my stress. Person on the phone was not helpful so I am waiting for a call back.

Everything went wrong, because as at the time of writing this review, the item is still sitting out my house blocking someone's window in this hot whether. 
Although, l paid for the service and confirmation was sent that the item will be removed on the 16th of June 2023. Today is the 21st of June and the item is not taken away as promised by a member of your staff. This is very frustrating.

David and Emre - Professional, Diligent and Friendly

David and Emre were polite, helpful, thorough, careful, hard-working and also went the extra mile in a couple of areas. This was in complete contrast to my original experience with another gardener from Servicestore. David and Emre arrived early and spent three hours following my requests and specification for hedge height reduction and trimming. I would definitely recommend these two guys. They are professional, diligent and actually pretty friendly. A pleasure to have them work on my hedge.

David and Emre from the gardening service made me feel at ease and safe, and David explained everything that he was going to do as my garden was badly overgrown and needed some tender loving care.

They worked quickly and thoroughly, and made sure a detailed clear up was completed once finished.

Reliable bin washing service

I've had the bin washing service for two years now and the service has been really good. It's kept the flies away from my brown bin which is super helpful in summer. The operatives are always friendly. I would recommend this service 100%

Overgrown garden cleared of weeds and rubbish.

On arrival to clear my overgrown garden from very tall weeds! David introduced himself and his colleague Emre. After David inspected the work requested and collected the tools required, both immediately started work. They were extremely polite and David very informative in explaining how they would carry out the work. They worked speedily and efficiently without fuss (the weather was hot today). They were careful when taking the rubbish through my home to the front. I was very pleased with their work and would not hesitate to request their garden services in the future.

It's so simple to get things done

I had to get rid of a useless broken ironing board, a unwieldy sheared-off clothes rail, and the heavy base of a long-lost garden parasol. Doing all that myself without a van was hopeless. But it was all so easy to arrange to arrange online and they came to collect it all from my front garden path within 48 working hours of my request. Best of all, the guys who came were really cheery and we waved to each other through the window. Priceless.

Efficient, professional, hard working gardeners

Really happy with clearance of my garden, which had been left to go wild over a period of time. Tall hedges, weeds, lawn and patio areas had become too much for me to manage. Front garden was an eyesore covered in weeds. The team made it look easy, with all the tools and equipment at their disposal, I saw the garden unfold before my eyes. It is now completely clear, unruly bushes shaped, trees pruned and patio totally weed free. They put a membrane down in the front garden, around the magnolia tree, so all I need to do is get stones and/or bark delivered to finish off. i would 100% recommend WF Servicestore. The team were enthusiastic, polite, friendly with suggestions and advice for my garden going forward. They also respected my property at all times. Many thanks to John, Emre and Jamel for their hard work. It’s great to have my garden back!

A good job

The 2 gentlemen, Said and Alfie came to install the water butt on Thursday and they were genuinely very nice. Before installing the water butt, they surveyed the outside of the property, because they hadn't seen this property before. They explained how the water butt works. We went through a few options of whereabouts to install it. This even came with a demonstration using a bottle of water and the wrong piping and the references to physics. They worked professionally. They have a very good relationship with one another and they were respectful to me and to the property.
They tidied up afterwards.

Best Customer Service ever

I have just had a small water butt installed and I must say it was a great service. Chris was so polite and respectful. He explained that he would let me see the water before he completed the installation in case I didn’t want it in that position or whether it was too big et cetera. He was very respectful of my property and put those little blue shoe covers on every time he walked through the house. I couldn’t ask for better service. Thank you very much. He also gave me a free water saving shower-head, so that was an absolute bonus. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Chris to anyone who needs this work done

Chris and Sayed arranged and fitted a water butt for us today, they couldn't have been more helpful or cheerful - they did a great job and were a pleasure to have around. No mess afterwards either - Highly recommend :)

Good experience and work for good price

Our experience was very good: for notably competitive price, we got a proper quote visit followed by good work - the handyman seemed clearly competent, was pleasant to have in the house, did the work to a good standard, and managed the one tricky bit in a way that exceeded out expectations by quite a bit. And, at the backend, dealing with the service store to organise this also proved easy and pleasant. Will use them again and would recommend, at least based on that one experience

Plastering

It is worth contacting them to see if they will do services that are not listed. They repaired some blown plaster for me. It was not cheap but I had the reassurance that they were a trustworthy company as they are connected to the council. Sunil did a lovely job and was pleasant and friendly.

Every admin desk should have a Valerie

I was trying unsuccessfully to connect with the OT team and eventually connected with Valerie who worked on the adult social care desk. I cannot believe how quickly she resolved my problem by not only locating the OT I was trying to get in touch with (despite them being new to the team and she had never spoken to before) but then transferring the call so I w as able to speak directly.

I do not live in the borougho of Waltham Forest but have always been very impressed with their efficiency at dealing with my elderly relative. Today, again I was blown away. Thank you very much. I wish more councils operated in this way.

Brilliant Butt!

I had been meaning to apply for the free water butt but hadn’t gotten round to it. I bumped into Sayed who was in my street fitting them and he said he could do it right away. It took less than 15 mins, he was professional and beyond polite and now I have a water butt. Brilliant initiative.

Affordable and good service

I used the service to remove some big furniture items I needed to clear out of the house. The service was really affordable and I received a response to my quote request form really quickly. The team who came were amazing and did a great job. My only constructive feedback is to create a better booking system and flexibility - I was sent an email with an allocated date and time, there was no discussion or consulting with me when would work, and it wasn't possible to receive a narrowed down time slot and was simply given a "9am - 4pm" timeframe. Given we don't live at the property, that was stressful for us to arrange. However, I appreciate that the collection team did call ahead of time as I had requested and waited for us to arrive.

Today, Sayed came out to fit my waterbutt that was provide free by Waltham Forest. 
Sayed, was friendly and advised on the best position on where to put my waterbutt. He was efficient and the waterbutt was fitted in less than 15 mins. We also had a great chat about how rainwater is better for certain plants and talked about what seeds we were growing ??
A great incentive by Waltham Forest topped off with excellent customer service from Sayed. My plants will be happy this summer!!
